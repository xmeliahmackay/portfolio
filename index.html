              <p>Meliah grew up spending a lot of her time in her mothers office as a young child. In the office she had lots of free time to play on the computers. She loved to practice typing on the computer and playing around with simple applications such as paint. When Meliah started gaining job experience she dove into the customer service field from fine dining, to selling designer bags Meliah loved to talk and interact with people. When Meliah got her first full time job she realized that she wanted to change her career to something that made her feel like she was using her brain more than her current job. She then started to teach herself how to code, utilizing sites like <a href="https://freecodecamp.org">Free Code Camp </a> and <a href="https://youtube.com">Youtube </a> to practice, read, and teach herself. As she got deeper into learning about code she had decided that she wanted to look into schols and came across Epicodus. </p>
